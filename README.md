# PageTree

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A tool for knowledge organization as a form of pages structured in tree-like method with highly interconnected and internavigatable elements for automatic, manually configured or based on spaced-repetition algorithm flashcards generation.

In the future could also contain features like paths, courses, lessons (a'ka Pluralsight), but of course with the previously mentioned tooling for material rehearsal it would make a great combo.

Once again in bulletpoints:
- structurized knowledge base of any domain - initially created for japanese language learning with potential to expand for other subjects
- automatically generated flashcards - depending on what level of the pages / knowledge tree you will navigate to and want the flashcard start to be generated from
- spaced repetition algorithm, proposing already searched or learned materials - all configurable
- target plaforms - web and mobile
- working online and offline

## Problem Description

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preparing notes requires time and effort, which could be spend on just learning itself. Of course it does not have to be absolutely excluded from a learning process, since it's a way to learn by itself too. Although, why to waste time just to convert a knowledge from one type of media to the other, when it's just can be ready to consume.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Browsing, learning from the same notes either written down on a paper or a computer every day becomes so boring after a time.. It brings routine. It slowly makes you start to procrastinate again.
